# Annoying Interlocutor Bot for Telegram Web

This bot is designed for chatting with an annoying interlocutor on [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org/). Unlike a typical bot, it does not use any Telegram API. Instead, it's just a script that you inject directly into the webpage.

## How It Works

The script monitors the conversation in a Telegram Web chat and automatically sends responses to a specified user or replies with lines from a song. It can be used to humorously interact with or respond to someone in a repetitive or automated manner.

## Installation

To use this bot, you need to inject the script into the Telegram Web page. You can use tools like:

- [User JavaScript and CSS Injector](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pkoacgokdfckfpndoffpifphamojphii)
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- Any other similar browser extension or tool that allows you to inject JavaScript into a webpage.

### Steps to Install:

1. **Install an Extension**: Choose and install a JavaScript injection tool such as Tampermonkey or User JavaScript and CSS Injector.
2. **Add the Script**: Copy the bot script from this repository and add it to the extension you installed.
3. **Open Telegram Web**: Go to [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org/) in your browser.
4. **Inject the Script**: Use the extension to inject the script into the Telegram Web page.
5. **Start the Bot**: Follow the on-screen instructions to configure and start the bot.

## Features

- **Automated Responses**: The bot can send automated responses to a specific user in the chat.
- **Song Lyrics Mode**: The bot can reply with lines from a pre-defined song.
- **Customizable Intervals**: Control how often the bot sends messages using random time intervals.

## Disclaimer

This bot is intended for fun and should be used responsibly. Since it injects JavaScript directly into the webpage, use it at your own risk and be aware of the Terms of Service of Telegram.
